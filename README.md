# trac: Tree-based Aggregation of Compositional Data

This R package implements the [describe method here and link to paper].

The easiest way to install `trac` is by using the [devtools](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/devtools/index.html) R package (if not already installed, open R and type `install.packages("devtools")`). To install `trac`, type

``` r
devtools::install_github("jacobbien/trac")
```

in R. This installs `trac` from github.
